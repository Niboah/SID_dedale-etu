# Welcome to the Dedale project.

This project is developed at Sorbonne University, Paris, France. It is used during the FoSyMa course (from the French “Fondement des Systèmes Multi-Agents”) as a practical application of Multi-Agents Systems (MAS). 
It allows Master's students to obtain a first-hand experience of some of the nice (and sometimes difficult) characteristics that comes with agents and distributed systems :
 - distribution and asynchronism (system and communication),
 - autonomy, decision and coordination in uncertain and partially observable environments

**Your goal here is "simple", you have to conceive and implement the behaviours of a team of heterogeneous agents that have to explore an unknown environment in order to collect the maximum amount of treasure in a given time frame.** This game is inspired by the famous "Hunt the Wumpus"  of (Gregory Yob)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Yob]
